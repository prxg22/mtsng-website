I´ve worked as a product designer at Intermarine Yachts, a leading Brazilian shipyard focused on the premium segment and high-end goods. In 2014 I´d moved to New Zealand where I took a project management course and also worked at the entertainment sector, besides seeking for one of my big dreams which was to learn how to sail. Almost 3 years and 16 countries later, I ́ve returned to Brazil and I was invited to come back to Intermarine. Now led by one of the youngest CEOs in the country, the company is heading to exportation and aiming to modernize the production. I believe in a design able to cause a positive impact beyond the product value and that constantly pursues a relevant meaning not only to the final user but to the whole production cycle. A design to improve people’s lives, for the person beyond the costumer. </div> <div id="awards" class="col-lg-4 col-hd-4 col-md-4 col-xs-4"> <h3>Recognition</h3> <ul> <li>2014 A&#39; Design Award and Competition Golden A&#39; Design Award Winner</li> <li>28º Prêmio de Design Do Museu da Casa Brasileira Honor Mention at Transportation Category</li> </ul> <h3>Academy</h3> <ul> <li>Lorem Ipsum, 2019</li> </ul> </div> </div> </section> <section id="work"> <article> <div class="row"> <div class="title col-hd-4 col-lg-4 col-xs-4"> <h4>Work</h4> <h2>Intermarine</h2> </div> <div class="desc col-hd-4 col-lg-4 col-xs-4"> <p> Intermarine is a leading Brazilian shipyard focused on luxury yachts, specialized in the premium segment and high-end goods. There, I am part of the team responsible for the product development, supervising new projects and its construction from the concept throughout the production line. Among all the 15 projects I ́ve been part, I highlighted the 48 Offshore and the future Intermarine 56, two projects in which I was the primary designer. </p> <p> </p><h4>the office</h4> An Intermarine yacht project results from an integrated effort between the Marketing, Architecture &amp; Design and Engineering teams. As a designer I could take part in all the development cycle, collaborating to find unexplored market positions, creating concepts and building exterior, interior 3D models and constructive drawings for systems and furniture. <p></p> <p> </p><h4>the factory</h4> A shipyard like Intermarine is a group of many sectors which have different roles, techniques and methods of work. Lamination, assembly, woodwork, painting, tapestry and others sectors use the guidelines delivered by the project teams so is very important to keep a close relationship between the office and the factory. I´ve been spending a big part of my daily routine at the sectors supervising, sharing knowledge and learning about workers’ pain points and opportunities for improvements. To increase technical awareness, we have brought more workers from different sectors to take part in the projecting processes. We believe this exchange at the initial moments of the project is very important to achieve a more assertive final product that will face fewer setbacks during production. <p></p> </div> </div> <div class="gallery"> <div class="gallery__container"> <img src="/mtsng-website/intermarine3.7a417adf.jpg" alt="Calor da Rua - FAQ"> <img src="/mtsng-website/intermarine1.126f4401.gif" alt="Calor da Rua - Map"> <img src="/mtsng-website/intermarine2.eaa97c0f.jpg" alt="Calor da Rua - Home"> <img src="/mtsng-website/intermarine4.7a33b4cc.jpg" alt="Calor da Rua - FAQ 2"> </div> </div> <hr> </article> <article> <div class="row"> <div class="title col-hd-4 col-lg-4 col-xs-4"> <h4>Freela</h4> <h2>Calor da Rua</h2> </div> <div class="desc col-hd-4 col-lg-4 col-xs-4"> <p>Calor da Rua is an app idealized to gather valuable information about homelessness in São Paulo. With the dictum “Census with a good sense”, the app seeks to make qualitative research to access necessities, listen to stories and obtain knowledge to feed a database that will be used as a core for initiatives and projects dedicated to improve the lives of the homeless population. The proposal below is the result of a multidisciplinary group endeavor throughout a UX design Bootcamp.</p> <h4>the initiative</h4> <p>In 2018, São Paulo government estimated there are approximately 20.000 people living on the streets of the city but many specialized groups think the right number is higher than that. How big the street population really is? Who are they and what are their needs? Ecos, a social mobility articulator created Calor da Rua with the objective of trying to find these answers as well as be the base for an ecosystem of groups that work on the streets of the city and would gather data.</p> <h4>briefing</h4> <p>On the date of our first meeting with Ecos, a beta version of the app have been tested for 6 months and some problems were already very clear. Calor da Rua was basically a map where you could add pins at homeless individuals locations, and a questionnaire to guide the volunteer during a conversation. One of the main problems was that the app didn’t allow the volunteer review or edit any information just giving the volunteer one chance of gathering all the answers which was almost impossible. Ecos ‘s been through a hard time discovering ways to use the app to attract other groups to amplify the planned ecosystem.</p> <h4>the research</h4> <p>We’ve planned the research phase focusing our efforts on three main groups:</p> <h5>homeless population</h5> <p>We’d spoken with homeless individuals to discover how the impact of the volunteer's work was noticed by them, what they liked and disliked and how it could be improved in their point of view.</p> <p>Most of the individuals who has been interviewed recognized the importance of volunteers to assist their lives, however, they pointed out the lack of consistency as a factor that prevented the building of a strong relationship between the parts. They saw with skepticism the willingness of the volunteer groups because generally they’d been seen once or twice and then never again.</p> <h5>people outside volunteering groups</h5> <p>We used an online form to gather information about the point of views and perceptions about the homelessness problems and to identify possible key points to engage these individuals on volunteerism. </p> <p>80% showed a willingness to participate in actions to help the homeless population but 70% didn’t know any group or NGOs to be part of.</p> <h5>groups and volunteers</h5> <p>We’ve interviewed volunteers used to work on the streets, some of them were testing the app, to find experiences, pain points and stories that could guide us to get a better understanding of the relation between them and the street population.</p> <p>A matter constantly pointed in the interviews was how important was to invest time on building a relationship with the individual on the street so that slowly access pain points and deep needs, and that an informal approach usually was more effective. With the app users, we could confirm the problem with the questionnaire. It was almost impossible to answer completely on the first try and some of the volunteers didn’t feel fit to ask some of the questions. They’ve pointed as well that a good data visualization and a more interactive map could improve the app usability.</p> <h4>the proposal</h4> <h5>a modular questionnaire</h5> <p>The research showed that the time spent creating a relation with the homeless individual was important to access relevant information. We believe the questionnaire could evolve gradually, following the relationship. We propose dividing the questions into modules of themes related to the homeless life and to some group’s expertise, allowing a more assertive approach and trying to avoid inexperienced volunteers asking questions about issues that they don't feel comfortable with. To grant that the volunteer would stick with the themes of his knowledge, the access to the modules would be controlled by the leaders of the volunteer groups.</p> <h5>telling the homeless people’s story</h5> <p>To make the information ́s visualization available and editable, we’ve created a profile page for the homeless person where the volunteer would be able to see the data already gathered and focused on subjects that there was no data or simply use the information to assist the individual. That profile would be created for the first volunteer that contacted the person in need and, being fed up by the volunteer's ecosystem, would create a database or, the person’s history. We propose to listening to stories instead of making interviews</p> <h5>volunteerism and stories of impact</h5> Ecos idealize that Calor da Rua can be a tool for motivation and engagement for old and future volunteers and also a way to promote the groups of the ecosystem. We transformed the actions and works, individual and collectively, into profiles for the volunteers and groups, stimulating the app users by making available a history of participation, stories listened and initiatives in which the volunteer or the group took part as well as the impact and results of these actions. <h5>a support network</h5> <p>We wanted to be able to show to the homeless people the possible results that providing information could bring to their life. We’ve developed a dashboard summarizing the main informations where you can see alerts posted by volunteers to communicate to the network about urgent needs so it can work to find a solution. The main map allows the volunteers to register locations that can provide assistance to the homeless population in different matters such as hospitals, shelter, employment, food, etc, and amplify the usability of the app beyond the gathering of data and turns it into a support tool for both volunteer and homeless.</p><p> </p><p>At the moment we are working with Ecos to develop an MVP version of the proposal to be built and test by the groups involved</p> <h5>the learnings</h5> <p>Be careful with the hero syndrome. Don't make assumptions. Learn how to listen actively and pay attention to things you are used to avoid, and when empathy may not be the right joyce, practice compassion. Fall in love with the problem, not the solution and trust the process!</p><p> </p></div> </div> <div class="gallery"> <div class="gallery__container"> <img src="/mtsng-website/home.932ba302.png" alt="Calor da Rua - Home"> <img src="/mtsng-website/map.5ea49b83.png" alt="Calor da Rua - Map"> <img src="/mtsng-website/emergency.5365840d.png" alt="Calor da Rua - FAQ 2"> <img src="/mtsng-website/faq.c8c24707.png" alt="Calor da Rua - FAQ"> <img src="/mtsng-website/faq2.156b932d.png" alt="Calor da Rua - FAQ 2"> </div> </div> </article> </section> </main> </div> </div> <script type="text/javascript" src="/mtsng-website/js.b6d9757e.js"></script> </body></html>
